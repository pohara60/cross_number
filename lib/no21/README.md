# No21 Puzzle Solver

## Introduction

The Listener Crossword No 4777 No 21 by Child's Play

Across and down clues are each given in ascending order of their answers. The clue numbers are for reference only and can be ignored. The 17 capital letters used in clues represent the integers from 0 to 16 in an order to be determined. Normal rules of algebra apply and X' means the reverse of X (where X has at least two digits, isn't a palindrome and doesn't end in 0). All operations in the clues are non-trivial, ie the resulting value is different from the operand(s). Answers are all different. There are no leading zeros. Seven cells must contain two digits. Numbers in brackets are the number of cells in the grid entry.

After filling the grid, solvers must replace the number in each cell with the letter used for it in the clues, with each of the 17 letters appearing at least once. Then the entire grid can be read systematically to find ten members of a set, sequenced conventionally. The five-letter word that completes the set must be written below the grid.

Across
1 B+Y (2)
2 IN (2)
3 C+K (2)
4 DF (2)
5 C' (2)
6 C+FT (2) 
7 L' (2)
8 B^N-N (2)
9 NR^N (2)
10 A!-(IR)' (2)
11 GNT (2)
12 IJ (3)
13 (AEI)' (3)
14 I'(N^)' (3)
15 ((C+K)N^A)' (3)
16 AE^A (2)
17 (G!+I'K)' (3)
18 D+E^FJR (3)
19 (square*prime)' (7)
Down
20 T (2)
21 I (2)
22 BR (2)
23 (B+D)(J-D)N (2)
24 C+I+J+K+L+T (2)
25 F(C+K) (2)
26 (JL')' (3)
27 A(AJ-O) (3)
28 (CER)' (2)
29 F^A-DT (2)
30 D(D^N-G) (3)
31 AL'NT (3)
32 (LY-O)RY (3)
33 K'(ND^N-M!) (3)
34 (square*prime)' (7)

5, 7, 20, 21 => C, L, T, I are two digits
16, 28, 29 must have two-digit cells
' operator implies operand is not palindrome or end in zero
