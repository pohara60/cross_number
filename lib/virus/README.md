KV Virus by Zag

In the land of Numerica there has been an outbreak of a KV virus. Such viruses include a key digit K and a viral digit V with neither K nor V zero. If the virus detects a number that includes any K it replaces it/them with a V provided there is no V already present. Such possession of a V bestows immunity on the number. 

In this puzzle every answer has been exposed to the virus and if susceptible infected to form the entry. Clue references are to the entries which are distinct, none starting with a zero. Note that while intersecting entries must be consistent, the corresponding uninfected intersecting answers need not be.
