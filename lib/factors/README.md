## Puzzle

Factored Greatest Common Factors by Czecker

The left-hand grid is a regular grid, with one digit per cell. Any two entries that meet are sure to share at least one prime factor.
The number in each cell of the right-hand grid is the greatest common factor of the two entries that cross at that cell in the first grid. The prime factorisation of each number in the second grid is shown.
The Greek letters (entry numbers) are for reference only. Each English letter represents a different prime number; consistently throughout the puzzle.
Each centre square is blank. All entries in the first grid are distinct, and none starts with zero.
