# Prime Cuts Puzzle Solver

## Introduction

Prime Cuts puzzles have these features:

-   It is a grid, similar to a crossword grid, with numbered clues across and down
-   The clues specify conditions for a 4 or 5 digit Value, a 2 digit Prime whose digits are removed from the Value to give the Grid entry, and the 2 or 3 digit Grid entry. For example:
    -   The Value is a multiple of the Prime
    -   The Prime is the reverse of the Prime for another clue
    -   The Grid entry is a multiple of the Prime
-   The Primes are distinct two digit numbers
-   Grid entries cannot start with 0
-   Numbers that are ascending or descending do not have repeated digits
